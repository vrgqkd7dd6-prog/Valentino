💘 Tyrell & Kat (Blair)
Kat… will you be my Valentine?
I made this page because you’re my comfort, my peace, and my favorite person to talk to.
Yes 💖 No 🙈 Open love letter 💌
Play our song 🎶 Phones (especially iPhone) usually need a tap to start music.
3 reasons I love you
	1	You made me feel safe to talk—like I could be real without worrying you’d break my trust.
	2	You stayed with me. Even when our messages are dry or full of love, seeing your name pop up still makes me smile.
	3	When life gets messy, you’re the first person I want to talk to. I cherish the way you support all of me—my emotions, my need for love, and the names you call me like “baby,” “babe,” “honeycake,” and “husband.”
I’m still learning how to be better in a relationship… but I’m trying because you’re worth it.
